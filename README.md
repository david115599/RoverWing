# RoverWing 
This repository contains files related to RoverWing, a shield (or "wing", following Adafruit's terminology) 
for Adafruit's Feather boards. This wing provides motor drivers, IMU, and connection ports for servos, sonars, GPS, 
and other peripherals commonly used by mobile robots. It also contains a microcontroller preloaded with firmware 
to control these peripherals, freeing the main Feather board.
